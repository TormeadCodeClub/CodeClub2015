    SUMMARY 
    <p>Our play is about Robin Hood. King John and The Sheriff Of Nottingham are demanding more taxes which makes the villagers unhappy. Marion leads the villagers and has very strong points of view! Marion finds an artical in the newspaper advertising 'The Merry Men'. The villagers think that The Merry Men are just what they need! So, they call upon The Merry Men. They send their troop of Skunk Scouts with the letter for Robin Hood asking for his help. Can they defeat The Sheriff and King John??</p>

    BLOOPERS
    <p>During rehearsal we had a few slip ups! We would like 
    to share these with you. We think that they will make you laugh!
   <li>The Sheriff of Nottigham tripped over Marion while trying to be intimidating.
   <li>King John shouted,'CANCEL THE TEAPOT!' instead of'CANCEL THE TORTURE!'
   <li>The Sheriff of Nottingham did not respond when Will Scarlet bonked him on the head with a gold plated bonker! 
   <li>King John tripped over the carpet while inspecting The Squisher.
   <li>Marion, while singing 'He's Just A Man' sang a rather high squeaky note by accident and we all burst out laughing!
   <li>The microphone wasn't working in rehearsal and it made a horrid sound which made everyone go deaf (slight exaggeration)!

   JOKES
   <p>JOKE 1:</p>
   <p>Pokewhistle: Window tax, door tax, chimney tax...</p>
   <p>Sheriff: No, no! You don't have to pay for your chimney.</p>
   <p>Scragbucket: Why not?</p>
   <p>Sheriff: It's on the house!</p>
   <p>JOKE 2:</p>
   <p>Grabbit: Let's kidnap him. I'll take the gold plated bonker, you watch my back. </p>
   <p> Bolt: Right!</p>
   <p>(Grabbit takes several comically deliberate steps towards Marion, with Bolt walking directly behind him, staring closely and intently at Grabbit's back. Bolt's nose is almost touching Grabbit's back. Grabbit stops abruptly and turns to see Bolt)</p>
   <p> Grabbit: What are you doing?</p>
   <p> Bolt: I'm watching your back.</p>
   <p> Grabbit: Idiot! I mean cover me!</p>
   <p> Bolt: Right!</p>
   <p>(Bolt throws the blanket over Grabbit.)</p>
   <p> JOKE 3:</p>
   <p>Bolt: But how will we catch Robin?</p>
   <p> Sheriff: You could lay a net over a hole.</p>
   <p> Grabbit: But she might fall in.</p>
   <p> Sheriff: Who?</p>
   <p> Grabbit: Annette.</p>
