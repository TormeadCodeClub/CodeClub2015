    <p> We have put together a production of Robin Hood and the Sherwood Hodies! Everyone in the year, has contributed, including the parents who have had amazing patience for the costume shopping and line learning. Although Mrs Fry is the real star of our show.
    Being calm and controlled during the scenes we had to repeat about 50 times. Mrs Fry has shown us what we are capable of if we really try, and every single one of us owe our great performance to her.<SPAN></SPAN>
